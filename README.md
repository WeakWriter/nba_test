test technique betclick

the project is in 2 parts : 
1) a jupyter notebook file where the reflexion is explained and we can see experimentation
2) a PYCHARM project where the code is packaged in objects and functions 
  This is made so that you can just clone the projet and open it with pycharm and it should work right away (providing you have the right dependencies)
